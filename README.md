# README

This repository contains a work-in-progress redesign of the sutra book for [Three Treasures Sangha](https://three-treasures-sangha.org/), a lay zen group affiliated with the Diamond Sangha. 

The idea behind this project is to update the book, correcting typographic errors, unifying page numbers between online and print versions, and making it look a little nicer in the process.

The texts are written in Markdown, and exported to HTML (for the web) and PDF (for print) using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/). All of this is done automatically, using [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).

# How to Edit 

To edit any of these documents, just click the pencil icon at the top right corner of any markdown file (files ending in *.md). If you don't already have a GitHub account, you'll be asked to create one. 

The text is styled in Markdown, a super-simple plain text markup language. Italics are usually written with underscores: _italics_, boldface with stars: **bold**, and links with brackets and parentheses: [a link](https://www.markdownguide.org/). You can use standard key combinations like Control+I to insert these characters. For a more complete guide, see [GitHub's documentation on Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax), or [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/).
